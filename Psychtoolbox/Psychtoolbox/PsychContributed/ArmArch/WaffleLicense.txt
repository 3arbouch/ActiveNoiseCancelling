% Screen on Linux, when compiled for multiple graphics and display
% backends, typically on embedded devices, utilizes Chad Versaces
% excellent Waffle display library, which is copyright and funded by
% Intel, licensed to us under a compatible OSS license - see below for
% exact licensing text: http://people.freedesktop.org/~chadversary/waffle/
%
% This folder contains a precompiled libwaffle-1.so library for Linux on
% ARM 32-Bit processors, specifically, this library was compiled and tested
% under 32-Bit Ubuntu 13.04 "Raring Ringtail" for ARM hardfloat architecture
% processors on a Google Nexus-7 tablet with NVidia Tegra-3 SoC. You must
% rename the library to libwaffle-1.so and place it in a system library
% folder (and possibly run sudo ldconfig) for it to work. It contains support
% for the X11/GLX and X11/EGL display backends. The Tegra binary drivers on
% the Nexus-7/Tegra-3 SoC only support X11/EGL display backend.
