% BitsPlusMovieDemo
%
% BitsPlusMovieDemo displays a counterphase flickering grating, by lookup
% table animation, using the Bits++ box.
%
% Note that you need to precompute the cluts and write them into
% offscreen memory in advance, so that the blits happen fast.  In
% this example, each clut goes into its own offscreen window.  In
% real applications, we have found that the precomputation is considerably
% faster if we allocate one large offscreen window and put each clut
% into a different rect inside of it.

% 9/20/02  dhb  Version created from ClutMovieDemo.
% 10/xx/02 jmh  Fixed it up.
% 11/4/02  dhb, jmh Comments, etc.
% 9/20/03  dhb  No more calls to BitsPlus mex file.
% 18/4/05  ejw  Converted it to run with OSX version of Psychtoolbox

% Define screen
whichScreen=max(Screen('Screens'));

% Find the color values which correspond to white and black.  Though on OS
% X we currently only support true color and thus, for scalar color
% arguments,
% black is always 0 and white 255, this rule is not true on other platforms will
% not remain true on OS X after we add other color depth modes.  
white=WhiteIndex(whichScreen);
black=BlackIndex(whichScreen);
gray=GrayIndex(whichScreen);

% Open up the a window on the screen.
% This is done by calling the Screen function of the Psychophysics
% Toolbox. We need to open the onscreen window first, so that
% the offscreen storage allocated subsequently is properly
% matched to the onscreen frame buffer.
[window,screenRect] = Screen('OpenWindow',whichScreen,128,[],32,2);

% make sure the graphics card LUT is set to a linear ramp
% (else the encoded data will not be recognised by Bits++).
% There is a bug with the underlying OpenGL function, hence the scaling 0 to 255/256.   
Screen('LoadNormalizedGammaTable',window,linspace(0,(255/256),256)'*ones(1,3));

% draw a gray background on front and back buffers
Screen('FillRect',window, gray);

Screen('FillRect',window, gray);

% Generate a uniform clut to hide the grating for the moment
offClut = ones(256,3)*(2^16-1)/2;
BitsPlusSetClut(window,offClut);

% find out how big the window is
[screenWidth, screenHeight]=Screen('WindowSize', window);

% textures can't seem to be bigger than the screen, though they have to be
% square. So the max texture size is the smaller of the screen dimensions!!
max_texture_size = min([screenWidth screenHeight]);

% Create a sinusoidal image in a Matlab matrix. The grating is
% scaled between 1 and 255. The creation happens in two steps. First
% create a sinusoidal vector, then replicate this vector to produce a
% sinusoidal image. The replication is done by an outer product. This is
% not the fastest way to do it in Matlab, but it is a little clearer.

% because we are going to borrow the top line of the image to encode a
% LUT, we need to make the image at least 524 pixels square.
nPixels = max_texture_size;
cyclesPerImage = 4;
sinVector = 1+(1+sin(2*pi*cyclesPerImage*(1:nPixels)/nPixels))/2*254;

% Create a set of color lookup tables (cluts) for animating the
% grating. Each clut starts life as a 256 by three matrix. But
% since we write them into the frame buffer to talk to the Bits++
% box, we then create an offscreen window for each clut and write
% it in.  This needs to be done in advance so that the blit of
% the lookup table is fast. 
%
% The computed set of cluts produces one cycle of counterphase flicker.
% We also create a uniform clut (offClut) to initialize the display.
%
% The variable nCluts determines the number of temporal quantization intervals.
%
% This routine does not do gamma correction -- it's purpose is just
% to show how to interface to the Bits++.

% We don't see it at this stage because we've got
% a uniform clut in the Bits++.
