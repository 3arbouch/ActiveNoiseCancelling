% BitsStereoDemo
%
% demonstration of displaying a precalculated texture based movie, whilst
% controlling the FE1 goggles using a Tlock packet.
%
% For use with the OSX version of Psychtoolbox.
% tested with version 1.0.5.
% uses the hidden 'LoadNormalizedGammaTable' screen function.
%
% Please note that this demo as configured needs 256MB system ram.
% It also needs the Bits++ from Cambridge Research Systems!!
%
% Sections have been lifted from the OSX movie demo etc.

clear all; close all

% Define screen
whichScreen=max(Screen('Screens'));

% Find the color values which correspond to white and black.  Though on OS
% X we currently only support true color and thus, for scalar color
% arguments,
% black is always 0 and white 255, this rule is not true on other platforms will
% not remain true on OS X after we add other color depth modes.  
white=WhiteIndex(whichScreen);
black=BlackIndex(whichScreen);
gray=GrayIndex(whichScreen);

% Open up the a window on the screen.
% This is done by calling the Screen function of the Psychophysics
% Toolbox. We need to open the onscreen window first, so that
% the offscreen storage allocated subsequently is properly
% matched to the onscreen frame buffer.
[window,screenRect] = Screen('OpenWindow',whichScreen,128,[],32,2);

% THE FOLLOWING STEP IS IMPORTANT.
% make sure the graphics card LUT is set to a linear ramp
% (else the encoded data will not be recognised by Bits++).
% There is a bug with the underlying OpenGL function, hence the scaling 0 to 255/256.  
% This demo will not work using a default gamma table in the graphics card,
% or even if you set the gamma to 1.0, due to this bug.
% This is NOT a bug with Psychtoolbox!
