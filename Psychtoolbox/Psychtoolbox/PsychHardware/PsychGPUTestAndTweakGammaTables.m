%
% PsychGPUTestAndTweakGammaTables - Test and tweak GPU hardware gamma tables.
%
% This function is a helper function used for high-precision display
% devices like the Bits# from CRS and DataPixx/ViewPixx/ProPixx from VPixx,
% which need identity passthrough of framebuffer pixel data to the video outputs
% without any interference by the GPU and other intermediate encoder circuitry.
%
% It augments functions like LoadIdentityClut, trying to cope with GPUs that
% are too broken to be fixable just by that function without any actual
% measurement of video signals.
% The function is called by toolboxes for special display output hardware
% and makes use of / calls back into hardware specific functions of that
% hardware to allow an iterative feedback loop of parameter tweaks and
% measurements to execute in order to optimize gamma tables for optimal
% pixel passthrough after other hardware-independent measures have failed.
%
% The routine is, e.g., used by the 'GPUEncoderTest' / 'CheckGPUSanity'
% functions of the PsychDatapixx and BitsPlusPlus functions.
%
% Input parameters: (Mandatory)
% 'win' = Onscreen window handle for onscreen window which displays to the
%         external high precision display device.
%
% 'deviceType' = Type of device: 0 = VPixx Inc. Data-/View-/Pro-Pixx.
%                                1 = CRS Bits#
% 
% 'injectFault' = 1 = Intentionally setup a slightly faulty LUT to perturb
%                 the signal and test the tweaking procedure. 0 = Don't.
%
% Returns 0 on success, 1 on failure.
