% Psychtoolbox/PsychHardware/LinuxX11ExampleXorgConfs
%
% This folder contains various example xorg.conf files
% for use on Linux with the X11 "X-Display" graphics
% system.
%
% These config files configure different multi-gpu or
% multi-screen configurations, where one or multiple
% graphics cards can be grouped into one or more x-screens
% aka Psychtoolbox Screens for use with Psychtoolbox for
% potential multi-display stimulation, of for having a
% separate "operator display" with desktop GUI and Octave
% or Matlab, and a separate "stimulation display(s)" for
% visual stimulation with Psychtoolbox and one or more
% onscreen windows.
%
% These samples were all successfully tested with various
% NVidia and AMD single and dual graphics card configurations
% with single display, dual-display, triple-display and quad-
% display setups, so they are all known to work.
%
% You will need to adapt some samples though for your specific
% display setup, so these are just meant to serve as a reference.
