function oldType = ShowCursor(type, screenid, mouseid)
% oldType = ShowCursor([type] [, screenid][, mouseid])
%
% ShowCursor redisplays the mouse pointer after a previous call to
% HideCursor. If the optional 'type' is specified, it also allows to alter
% the shape of the cursor. See following sections for details.
%
% The optional 'mouseid' allows to select which mouse cursor shall
% be redisplayed or changed in visual appearance. This only makes sense
% if you have multiple visible mouse cursors and is a Linux only feature.
%
% The return value 'oldType' is always zero, as this query mechanism is not
% supported with PTB-3. Just returned for backwards-compatibility.
%
% OSX, WINDOWS, LINUX: ______________________________________________________
%
% Cursor shape can be selected. These types are defined by name:
%
% 'Arrow' = Standard mouse-pointer arrow.
% 'CrossHair' = A cross-hair cursor.
% 'Hand' = A hand symbol.
% 'SandClock' = Some sort of sand clock/hour-glass (not available on OSX).
%
% Apart from that names, you can pass integral numbers for type to select
% further shapes. The mapping of numbers to shapes is operating system
% dependent, therefore not portable across different platforms. On
% MS-Windows, you can select between number 0 to 7. On Linux/X11 you can
% select from a wide range of numbers from 0 up to (at least) 152, maybe
% more, depending on your setup. See the C header file "X11/cursorfont.h"
% for a mapping of numbers to shapes. Passing invalid numbers can create
% errors. On Linux with Wayland backend, you can pass custom additional
% namestrings as 'type'.
%
% LINUX: ____________________________________________________________________
%
% Linux allows for display and handling of multiple mouse cursors if your
% X-Server is of version 1.7 or later, or if you use the Wayland display
% backend on a modern Wayland server.
%
% OSX: ______________________________________________________________________
%
% If provided, the optional "type" argument changes the cursor shape to:
%   0: Arrow
%   4: I Beam
%   5: Cross
%  10: Hand
