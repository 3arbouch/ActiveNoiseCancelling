function ListenChar(listenFlag)
% function ListenChar([listenFlag])
%
% Tell the Psychtoolbox function "GetChar" to start or stop listening for
% keyboard input.  By default ListenChar listens when no argument is
% supplied.  Passing 0 will turn off character listening and reset the
% buffer which holds the captured characters. Passing a value of 1 or not
% passing any value will enable listening. Passing a value of 2 will enable
% listening, additionally any output of keypresses to Matlabs or Octaves
% windows is suppressed. Use this with care, if your script aborts with an
% error, Matlab or Octave may be left with a dead keyboard until the user
% presses CTRL+C to reenable keyboard input. 'listenFlag' 2 is silently
% ignored on Matlab in -nojvm mode under MS-Windows.
%
% This function isn't entirely necessary to turn on listening as calling
% GetChar, CharAvail, or FlushEvents will trigger listening on. However,
% it is the only method by which to disable listening or switch between
% suppression of keyboard input to Matlab and unsuppressed mode.
%
% Please note that the commands ListenChar, CharAvail and GetChar are
% subject to various constraints and limitations, depending on the
% operating system you use, if you use Matlab in Java or -nojvm mode, if
% you use Octave, if you have Screen() onscreen windows open or not, or if
% you use KbQueueXXX functions in parallel or not. Therefore use of these
% functions can be troublesome for any but the most simple usages. Use of
% KbCheck, KbWait, KbStroke/Press/ReleaseWait is often simpler if you are
% just after keyboard input. Use of KbQueue functions, e.g., KbQueueCheck,
% KbQueueWait, KbTriggerWait is better suited for background keystroke
% collection. Use of KbEventAvail and KbEventGet is often more convenient,
% more flexible and subject to less restrictions and gotchas than use of
% GetChar et al.
%
% Some of the restrictions and caveats:
%
% 1. Works very well with Matlab and its Java based GUI enabled on Linux
% and MacOSX, as well as on WindowsXP.
%
% 2. When used on Windows Vista or later (Vista, Windows-7, Windows-8, ...)
% with Matlab's Java GUI, you cannot use any KbQueue functions at the same
% time, ie., KbQueueCreate/Start/Stop/Check/Wait as well as KbWaitTrigger,
% KbEventFlush, KbEventAvail, and KbEventGet are off limits after any call
% to ListenChar, ListenChar(1), ListenChar(2), FlushEvents, CharAvail or
% GetChar. You would need to call ListenChar(0) before you could call
% KbQueueCreate and then use those functions. Vice versa, after a call to
% KbQueueCreate, CharAvail, FlushEvents, and GetChar are dysfunctional and
% ListenChar may be limited. You need to call KbQueueRelease before you can
% use them again. This is generally true on MacOSX, and true for use of the
% default keyboard (the keyboard that GetChar et al. use) on MS-Windows and
% Linux. Use of other keyboards than the default keyboard, or of other
% devices, e.g., mouse or joystick, is not prohibited during use of GetChar
% et al.
%
% 3. If you use Matlab in "matlab -nojvm" mode without its GUI, or if you
% use GNU/Octave instead of Matlab, the same restrictions as in 2. apply -
% no parallel use of the default keyboards KbQueue.
% The only feature that works in parallel with KbQueues
% is the suppression of spilling of keystroke characters into the Matlab or
% Octave window during ListenChar(2) - at least on Linux and OSX, on
% Windows this can't be prevented at all in "matlab -nojvm" mode. However,
% if you switch to ListenChar(2) mode, you cannot break out of it by
% pressing CTRL+C on Linux if the keyboard queue that is in parallel use
% didn't get KbQueueStart called, ie. if it is stopped. On OSX with a
% stopped Keyboard queue, neither CTRL+C nor stopping a runaway script
% works.
%
% 4. On Linux, as a exception, some GetChar, CharAvail functionality may
% still work in case 3. under certain conditions, e.g., if you don't use
% ListenChar(2) and your Matlab/Octave is not in interactive mode.
%
% Also, GetChar can only collect keystrokes from multiple connected
% keyboards in case 1. In all other cases, it can only collect keystrokes,
% or respond to press of CTRL+C, for the default keyboard device. It will
% ignore other connected keyboards.
%
% Basically: Mixing GetChar et al. and modern KbQueue functions is usually
% not advisable, or if needed, great care must be taken to sidestep all the
% mentioned limitations. Also the KbQueue functions usually have better
% timing precision and allow to flexibly address multiple keyboards
% separately at least on Linux.

% HISTORY
%
% 7/19/05  awi   Wrote it.
% 6/20/06  awi   Use AddPsychJavaPath instead of AssertGetCharJava.
% 8/31/06  cgb   Works with the new character listening system.
% 9/19/06  mk    Modified to work on all Java enabled Matlabs and be a no-op
%                in all other configurations.
% 10/13/06 mk    Support for setting the redispatch-mode of GetChar and
%                friends.
% 05/31/09 mk    Add support for Octave and Matlab in noJVM mode.
