%
%  Obtains data about keypresses on the specified device since the 
%  most recent call to this routine, KbQueueStart, or KbQueueWait
%  Clears all scored events, but unscored events that are still being
%  processsed may remain in the queue
%
%  pressed: a boolean indicating whether a key has been pressed
%
%  firstPress: an array indicating the time that each key was first
%  pressed since the most recent call to KbQueueCheck or KbQueueStart
%
%  firstRelease: an array indicating the time that each key was first
%  released since the most recent call to KbQueueCheck or KbQueueStart
%
%  lastPress: an array indicating the most recent time that each key was
%  pressed since the most recent call to KbQueueCheck or KbQueueStart
%
%  lastRelease: an array indicating the most recent time that each key
%  was released since the most recent call to KbQueueCheck or 
%  KbQueueStart
%
%  For firstPress, firstRelease, lastPress and lastRelease, a time value
%  of zero indicates that no event for the corresponding key was
%  detected since the most recent call to KbQueueCheck or KbQueueStart
%
%  To identify specific keys, use KbName (e.g., KbName(firstPress)) to
%  generate a list of the keys for which the events occurred
%
%  For compatibility with KbCheck, any key codes stored in
%  ptb_kbcheck_disabledKeys (see "help DisableKeysForKbCheck"), will
%  not caused pressed to return as true and will be zeroed out in the
%  returned arrays. However, a better alternative is to specify a
%  keyList arguement to KbQueueCreate.
