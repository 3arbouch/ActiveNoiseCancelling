function SetMouse(x,y,windowPtrOrScreenNumber, mouseid)
% SetMouse(x, y [, windowPtrOrScreenNumber][, mouseid])
% 
% Position the mouse cursor on the screen.
%
% The cursor position (x,y) is "local" to the screen, i.e. relative to the
% origin of the screen if a screen number is supplied, or relative to the
% origin of a screen on which a supplied onscreen window is displayed.
% Otherwise it's "global", i.e. relative to the origin of the main screen
% (Screen 0).
%
% On Linux with X11, the optional 'mouseid' parameter allows to select
% which of potentially multiple cursors should be repositioned. On OS/X and
% Windows this parameter is silently ignored.
%
% On Linux with the Wayland backend, this function does nothing.
%
% The delay between a call to SetMouse and when GetMouse will report the
% new mouse cursor position is not known. GetMouse seems to report the new
% position immediately, but we have no guarantee that it always will.
