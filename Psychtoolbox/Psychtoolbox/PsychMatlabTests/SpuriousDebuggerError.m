function SpuriousDebuggerError
% Mathworks Case ID:  230201, reported 5/7/99
%
% The debugger works, but gives a spurious error message.
% 
% dear mathworks
% 
% Matlab 5.2.1 for Mac. Mac OS 8.5.1. I know you're not developing it now, 
% but it's my impression that you are still tracking bugs, in case you do 
% pick it up again. Could you record this bug in your database?
% 
% SPURIOUS ERROR MESSAGE: In earlier versions, before 5.2.1, the Debugger 
% wouldn't allow debugging of files in the Toolbox. Now it does (yay!), but 
% when you press the bug symbol, Matlab first beeps spuriously, giving the 
% misleading error message,
% "??? Error using ==> dbstatus Can't find M-file function."
% as it nevertheless opens the file in the Debugger and allows subsequent 
% debugging.
