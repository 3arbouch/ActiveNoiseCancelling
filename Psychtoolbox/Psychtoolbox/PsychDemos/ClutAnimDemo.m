function ClutAnimDemo(method)
% ClutAnimDemo([method=0])
%
% Display an animated grating using CLUT animation via the
% Screen('LoadNormalizedGammaTable') command, or via the PsychImaging()
% based clut animation support.
%
% Clut animation is an ancient technique of achieving animation, only
% needed or the best choice for very few use cases nowadays. Think twice
% before using this as your method of choice. It may work, but is inefficient,
% potentially unreliable in the timing domain (except for method 2) and most
% often more painful and inflexible to use than a proper modern approach.
%
% If 'method' is left out or set to 0, hardware gamma tables are
% immediately updated. A setting of 1 will update hardware gamma tables in
% sync with Screen('Flip'), or more accurately, it will try to.
% Synchronization can't be guaranteed, only that a good effort is made to
% achieve sync. A 'method' setting of 2 will use the Psychtoolbox image
% processing pipeline to implement clut animation, instead of updating the
% hardware gamma tables. This is the only reliable method with respect to
% timing precision. It is also the only method that works on MS-Windows.
% However, it requires recent graphics hardware and a bit more computation
% time.
%
% Method 2 is recommended for most use cases, method 0 is the least
% reliable one.

% HISTORY
%  7/05/05    mk    Wrote it.
%  22/07/05   fwc   Added SkipSyncTests preference call, slightly smaller texture,
%                   as drawtexture failed on s=400 on a 1024x768 pix screen
%                   in catch section, test if OrigLut exists before
%                   applying it.
%
%  4/4/11     mk    Add support for 'EnableCLUTMapping' method of
%                   PsychImaging.
%  22/07/14   mk    Fixup for gpu's with > 256 gamma table slots, in which this
%                   didn't work, as it assumed exactly 256 slots.
