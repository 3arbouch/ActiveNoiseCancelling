% Psychtoolbox:PsychDemos:ECVP2013
%
% Demos which were written specifically for the ECVP 2013 tutorial.
%
% See Psychtoolbox/PsychDocumentation/PTBTutorial-ECVP2013.pdf for
% reference.
%
% As opposed to best practices, these demos don't use the "function" key
% word at the top, so it was more easy to display content of various
% variables while stepping through code with the debugger during the
% tutorial session.
%
% The demos show the new PsychDefaultSetup(2); setup function and use a
% normalized color space between 0.0 and 1.0 instead of classic 0-255.
