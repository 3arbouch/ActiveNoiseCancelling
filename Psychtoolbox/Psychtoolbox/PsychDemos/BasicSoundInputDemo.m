function BasicSoundInputDemo(wavfilename, voicetrigger, maxsecs)
% BasicSoundInputDemo([wavfilename] [, voicetrigger=0] [, maxsecs=inf])
%
% Demonstrates very basic usage of the new Psychtoolbox sound driver
% PsychPortAudio() for audio capture / recording.
%
% Sound is captured from the default recording device, optionally waiting
% until the amplitude exceeds some threshold level before start of
% recording. At the end of the recording session the recorded sound is
% played back vie the default output device. Waveform data of captured
% sound is also plotted to a Matlab figure window during capture.
%
% This demo only demonstrates normal operation, not the low-latency mode,
% extra demos and tests for low-latency and high precision timing output will
% follow soon. If you need low-latency, make sure to read "help
% InitializePsychSound" carefully or contact the forum.
%
% Optional arguments:
%
% wavfilename = Name of a .wav sound file to store the recorded sound to.
%               If left out, sound won't be stored to filesystem.
% 
% voicetrigger = If set to a non-zero threshold value, the driver will wait
%                for the sound signal to exceed the specified voicetrigger threshold
%                level before it starts capturing audio data.
%
% maxsecs      = Maximum number of seconds of sound to capture. Defaults to
%                infinite - sound is recorded until a key is pressed.

% History:
% 06/30/2007 Written (MK)
% 08/10/2008 Add some sound onset time calculation for the fun of it. (MK)

    % the tCaptureStart timestamp may be inaccurate on some systems, and
    % therefore this tOnset timestamp may be off! See for example
    % PsychPortAudioTimingTest and AudioFeedbackLatencyTest for how to
    % setup low-latency high precision mode.
