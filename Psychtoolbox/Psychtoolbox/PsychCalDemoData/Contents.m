% This folder holds calibration data for the Psychophysics Toolbox.
% The calibration files here are for "typical" monitors, not for
% yours.  If you write a calibration file, we recommend putting
% it in a folder "PsychCalLocalData, placed outside of the
% "Psychtoolbox" folder but on Matlab's path.  The LoadCal and
% SaveCal routines will read and write to the local folder first,
% and if you create one it will not get overwritten when you
% install a new version of the toolbox.
