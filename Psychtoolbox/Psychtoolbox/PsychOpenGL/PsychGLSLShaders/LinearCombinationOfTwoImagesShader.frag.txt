/* LinearCombinationOfTwoImagesShader.frag.txt
 * A fragment shader that computes a pixel-wise weighted linear combination
 * of two input image textures bound to Image1 and Image2:
 * outimage(x,y) = (Image1Weight * Image1(x,y)) + (Image2Weight * Image2(x,y));
 *
 * This one is e.g., used by the new moglmorpher.m for fast shape morphing
 * on the GPU.
