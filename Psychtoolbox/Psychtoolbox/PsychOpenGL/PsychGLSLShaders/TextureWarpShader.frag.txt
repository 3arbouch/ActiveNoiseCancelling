/* Shader for warping/distortion of textures during drawing.
 * This shader is meant for image distortion/warping. It is used by
 * the high-level routine AddImageWarpToGLOperator.m
 *
 * The shader is meant for blitting a texture to the framebuffer. It
 * perturbs the texture lookup coordinates by some 2D offset, which it
 * reads from a distortion/warpmap bound to the "WarpMap" sampler.
