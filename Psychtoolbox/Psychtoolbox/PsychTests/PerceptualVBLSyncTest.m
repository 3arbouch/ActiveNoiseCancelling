function PerceptualVBLSyncTest(screen, stereomode, fullscreen, doublebuffer, maxduration, vblSync, testdualheadsync)
% PerceptualVBLSyncTest(screen, stereomode, fullscreen, doublebuffer, maxduration, vblSync, testdualheadsync)
%
% Perceptual synchronization test for synchronization of Screen('Flip') and
% Screen('WaitBlanking') to the vertical retrace.
%
% Arguments:
% 'screen' Either a single screen handle, or none (in which case the
% display with the maximum id will be used), or a vector of two handles in
% stereomode 10, e.g., [0 1] if you want to output to screens 0 and 1. You
% can also pass a vector of two screens when stereomode is not set to 10.
% In this case two separate (non-stereo) onscreen windows will be opened on
% both displays and they will get flipped in multiflip mode 2. That means
% that the first display (first element of 'screen') is synced to VBL, but
% the 2nd one is synced to bufferswaps of the first one. This is a
% straightforward test to check if two displays of a stereosetup run with a
% synchronized retrace cycle (good!) or if they are phase-shifted or
% drifting against each other (not good!).
%
% 'stereomode' Which stereomode to use? Defaults to zero, ie. no stereo.
%
% 'fullscreen' Fullscreen presentation? Defaults to 1 ie. yes. In
% non-fullscreen mode, no proper synchronization of bufferswaps can be
% expected.
%
% 'doublebuffer' Single- or double-buffering (1). Defaults to 1. In single
% buffer mode there is no sync to retrace, so this is a good way to
% simulate the tearing artifacts that would happen on sync failure, just to
% get an impression.
%
% 'maxduration' Maximum runtime of test: Runs until keypress or maxduration
% seconds have elapsed (Default is 10 seconds).
%
% 'vblSync' If 1, synchronize bufferswaps to vertical retrace of monitor,
% otherwise (setting 0) swap immediately without sync, ie., usually with tearing.
%
% 'testdualheadsync' If 1, and 'vblSync' is zero, manually wait until the video
% scanout position reaches half the height of the display, then swap. If this
% is done on a multi-display setup and the video scanout cycles of all the
% participating displays are properly synchronized, you should see a "static"
% crack line roughly at half the height of the display, maybe a bit lower. If
% you see a wandering crack line, at least on some displays, or you see vertical
% offsets of the position of the crack line between displays, then the displays
% are not properly synchronized, ie., not suitable for artifact free binocular
% stimulation. Caveat: This logic has been developed and tested specifically
% for testing on Linux with a single X-Screen spanning multiple displays. It may
% or may not be suitable to assess other operating systems or display configurations.
%
% After starting this test, you should see a flickering greyish background
% that flickers in a homogenous way - without cracks or weird moving patterns
% in the flickering area. If you see an imhogenous flicker, this means that
% synchronization of stimulus onset to the vertical retrace doesn't work due
% to some serious bug or limitation of your graphics hardware or its driver.
% If you don't know what this means, you can test this script with parameter
% doublebuffer == 0 to artificially create a synchronization failure.
%
% On many systems you should also see some emerging pattern of yellow horizontal lines.
% These lines should be tightly concentrated/clustered in the topmost area of
% the screen. Lots of yellow lines in the middle or bottom area or even
% randomly distributed lines indicate some bug in the driver of your graphics
% hardware. This is a common problem of all ATI graphics adapters on MacOS-X
% versions earlier than OS-X 10.4.3 when running a dual-display setup...
%
% A second reason for distributed yellow lines could be bad timing on your
% machine, e.g., due to background activity by virus scanners or the Spotlight
% indexing service on OS-X. Turn these off for conducting your studies!

%             on multi-display setups. That test wasn't well received :(
