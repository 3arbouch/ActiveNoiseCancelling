function OSXCompositorIdiocyTest(testScreen, distractorScreen)
% OSXCompositorIdiocyTest - Test for potential OSX compositor brokeness.
%
% Usage:
%
% OSXCompositorIdiocyTest([testScreen=max][, distractorScreen]);
%
% This test tests if the OSX desktop compositor is potentially
% interfering with Screen('Flip') on a fullscreen window on a
% display, especially in dual-display, dual-window configurations.
%
% The test performs 300 black-white flips on 'testScreen'.
% Then it optionally opens a fullscreen window on 'distractorScreen',
% and repeats the 300 black-white flips on 'testScreen'. The 2nd
% window does nothing.
%
% What you should observe is black-white flicker in both "PASS I"
% and "PASS II". If you observe flicker, that's a good sign, although
% not a guarantee that everything is fine, timing-wise, on your system.
%
% If you observe no flicker in "PASS I" then your systems flip
% implementation is totally broken and not recommended for any
% timing-sensitive visual stimulation.
%
% If you observe flicker in "PASS I", but not in "PASS II" - when
% the distractor window is open on 'distractorScreen', then your
% system is possibly fine for single-display stimulation, but
% broken for dual-display (e.g., binocular, stereoscopic, stereoMode 10)
% stimulation wrt. presentation timing and timestamping.
%
% What this test does is it alternates between the two buffers
% of the doublebuffered window. One buffer is filled black, the
% other white.
% - If Screen('Flip') is executed by your operating system
% and graphics hardware via so called page-flipping, then you should
% observe flicker and the timing and timestamping of visual stimuli
% should be research grade.
%
% - However, there is still some chance of observing flicker even
% if page-flipping isn't used, but the desktop compositor is active
% in a triple-buffer configuration. Therefore a successfull run of
% this test is not 100% proof that you are safe from timing woes.
%
% If you don't observe flickering then this means a desktop compositor
% or copy-swapping is active and the presentation timing and timestamps
% are not to be trusted!
%
% So far we know that at least OSX 10.8.5 with AMD graphics hardware
% works properly for single-window / single-display visual stimulation,
% but *not* in dual-window stimulation!
% There is some indication that this dual-display stimulation OSX bug
% can be possibly resolved or worked around via the applying the
% Screen('Preference','ConserveVRAM', x); setting with x = 16384 or
% x = 8192. Results look promising but are not 100% certain.
%
% So far we also know that at least OSX 10.9.0 - 10.9.2 with NVidia
% graphics hardware do not work properly at all in any configuration!
