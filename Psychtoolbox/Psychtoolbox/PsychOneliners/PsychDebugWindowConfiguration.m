function PsychDebugWindowConfiguration(opaqueForHID, opacity)
% Switch PTB's onscreen window into a display mode suitable for easy debugging on single-screen setups.
%
% This function allows to setup Screen onscreen windows to be
% partially transparent, so one can simultaneously see the stimulus display and
% the Matlab window and other GUI windows.
%
% Usage: PsychDebugWindowConfiguration([opaqueForHID=0][, opacity=0.5])
%
% To enable: Call PsychDebugWindowConfiguration before the Screen('OpenWindow',...) call!
% To disable: Type "clear Screen" or "clear all".
%
% The optional parameter 'opaqueForHID' if set to a non-zero value will
% disallow mouse clicks and other mouse actions to "get through" to the
% GUI, ie., it will make the onscreen window opaque to the mouse pointer.
%
% A setting of -1 will disable the transparency again, but *keep all timing tests
% and timestamping disabled*.
%
% The optional parameter 'opacity' controls how opaque the onscreen window
% is, in a range of 0.0 to 1.0 for 0% to 100% opacity. By default the
% window is 50% opaque (or 50% transparent if you like).
%
% Stimulus onset timing and timestamping will be inaccurate in this mode
% and graphics performance will be reduced! Don't use for timing tests or
% during real experiment sessions!
%
% This feature will only work reliably - or at all - if your operating
% system is running with a compositing window manager installed and
% enabled. This is the case for Windows Vista, Windows-7/8 and later MS
% operating systems, as well as MacOS/X, and most GNU/Linux distributions
% which have a compositing desktop installed and enabled, e.g., KDE,
% GNOME-2/3, Compiz, Unity.
%
% Keyboard and mouse input may not work as expected under all conditions,
% i.e., it may by impaired in either Psychtoolbox, or for the other running
% applications. Good luck!

% History:
% 30.07.2009 mk  Written.
% 15.11.2009 mk  Now also for Windows and Linux.
% 22.08.2013 mk  Disable any high-precision timestamping on all operating systems.
% 09.09.2013 mk  No special case handling for OSX needed anymore.
% 31.12.2014 mk  On Wayland, timing is expected to be good, so don't skip sync tests etc.
