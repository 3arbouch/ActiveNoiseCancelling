	Copyright:		Copyright Â© 2008-2012 Mario Kleiner, derived from an Apple example code.

	Change History of original Apple sample code (most recent first):

            1.1			05/22/2007			User client performs endian swapping when called from a user process 
											running using Rosetta. Updated to produce a universal binary.
											Now requires Xcode 2.2.1 or later to build.
			
			1.0d3	 	01/14/2003			New sample.

// User client method dispatch table.
//
// The user client mechanism is designed to allow calls from a user process to be dispatched to
// any IOService-based object in the kernel. Almost always this mechanism is used to dispatch calls to
// either member functions of the user client itself or of the user client's provider. The provider is
//  the driver which the user client is connecting to the user process.
//
// While this sample shows one case of dispatching calls directly to the driver (ScalarIScalarO),
// it is recommended that calls be dispatched to the user client. This allows the user client to perform
// error checking on the parameters before passing them to the driver. It also allows the user client to
// do any endian-swapping of parameters in the cross-endian case. (See ScalarIStructI below for further
// discussion of this subject.)
//
// The dispatch table makes use of the sentinel values kMethodObjectThis and kMethodObjectProvider to
// represent at compile time the values of the this pointer and fProvider respectively at run time.
