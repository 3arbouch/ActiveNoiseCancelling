		Only OS X

	HISTORY:
	
		7/16/02		awi		Wrote it.  Split off from PsychPlatform.h
		11/3/04		awi		Corrected errors in comments and improved DESCRIPTION and TO DO comments.  
	 	
	DESCRIPTION:
	
		PsychPlatform.h contains constant definitions asserting conditions
		specific to the the OS X version of Screen.  If you  
		use a conditional macro wich branches according to one of the constants
		in this file, then that conditional macro does not belong here.
		
		Note that this should be the ONLY Psychtoolbox file which is conditionally
		included by platform.  Exceptions to this rule might be:
		-project.def files included in VC++ files
		-StdAfx pre-compiled header files included in VC++ files.

	
	TO DO:
	
		For now the project path specifies which platform version of this file to 
		include, with each version of this file defining constants which identify
		the platform.  A smarter way to do this would be to use a single version 
		of this file which detects contants defined within the compilation 
		environment, for example as a flag passed to the compiler.
