 * presentation - timed presentation related wl_surface requests

 * 
 *
 * The main feature of this interface is accurate presentation timing
 * feedback to ensure smooth video playback while maintaining audio/video
 * synchronization. Some features use the concept of a presentation clock,
 * which is defined in presentation.clock_id event.
 *
 * Request 'feedback' can be regarded as an additional wl_surface method.
 * It is part of the double-buffered surface state update mechanism, where
 * other requests first set up the state and then wl_surface.commit
 * atomically applies the state into use. In other words, wl_surface.commit
 * submits a content update.
 *
 * When the final realized presentation time is available, e.g. after a
 * framebuffer flip completes, the requested
 * presentation_feedback.presented events are sent. The final presentation
 * time can differ from the compositor's predicted display update time and
 * the update's target time, especially when the compositor misses its
 * target vertical blanking period.

	 *
	 * This event tells the client in which clock domain the

	 * extension. This clock is called the presentation clock.
	 *
	 * The compositor sends this event when the client binds to the
	 * presentation interface. The presentation clock does not change
	 * during the lifetime of the client connection.
	 *
	 * The clock identifier is platform dependent. Clients must be able
	 * to query the current clock value directly, not by asking the
	 * compositor.
	 *
	 * On Linux/glibc, the identifier value is one of the clockid_t
	 * values accepted by clock_gettime(). clock_gettime() is defined
	 * by POSIX.1-2001.
	 *
	 * Compositors should prefer a clock which does not jump and is not
	 * slewed e.g. by NTP. The absolute value of the clock is
	 * irrelevant. Precision of one millisecond or better is
	 * recommended.
	 *
	 * Timestamps in this clock domain are expressed as tv_sec_hi,
	 * tv_sec_lo, tv_nsec triples, each component being an unsigned
	 * 32-bit value. Whole seconds are in tv_sec which is a 64-bit
	 * value combined from tv_sec_hi and tv_sec_lo, and the additional
	 * fractional part in tv_nsec as nanoseconds. Hence, for valid
	 * timestamps tv_nsec must be in [0, 999999999].
	 *
	 * Note that clock_id applies only to the presentation clock, and
	 * implies nothing about e.g. the timestamps used in the Wayland
	 * core protocol input events.

 * space scheduling is not acceptable for this flag. If presentation is
 * done by a copy to the active frontbuffer, then it must guarantee that
 * tearing cannot happen.
 *
 * HW_CLOCK: The display hardware provided measurements that the hardware
 * driver converted into a presentation timestamp. Sampling a clock in user
 * space is not acceptable for this flag.
 *
 * HW_COMPLETION: The display hardware signalled that it started using the
 * new image content. The opposite of this is e.g. a timer being used to
 * guess when the display hardware has switched to the new image content.
 *
 * ZERO_COPY: The presentation of this update was done zero-copy. This
 * means the buffer from the client was given to display hardware as is,
 * without copying it. Compositing with OpenGL counts as copying, even if
 * textured directly from the client buffer. Possible zero-copy cases

	 * The timestamp corresponds to the time when the content update
	 * turned into light the first time on the surface's main output.
	 * Compositors may approximate this from the framebuffer flip
	 * completion events from the system, and the latency of the

	 * may occur. This is to further aid clients in predicting future
	 * refreshes, i.e., estimating the timestamps targeting the next
	 * few vblanks. If such prediction cannot usefully be done, the
	 * argument is zero.
	 *
	 * The 64-bit value combined from seq_hi and seq_lo is the value of

	 * video mode switches excluded, then the refresh argument must be
	 * zero.

	 * refresh cycle, or the output device is self-refreshing without a
	 * way to query the refresh count, then the arguments seq_hi and
